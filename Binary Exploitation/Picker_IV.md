# Description

Can you figure out how this program works to get the <br>
flag? <br>
Connect to the program with netcat: <br>
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56193 <br>
The program's source code can be downloaded here. <br>
The binary can be downloaded here.

# Solution

Source code: ```wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/529/picker-IV.c```

Binary: ```wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/529/picker-IV```

You could look at the source code, `cat picker-IV.c`, or compile, `gcc picker-IV.c` then run `./a.out` to see that the program lets you give it an address to jump to.

`objdump -D picker-IV | less`

This will let you filter for "win" when you type / and then you can see the address of the win function (000000000040129e).

`nc saturn.picoctf.net 56193`

By putting the function address without 0x it gives you the flag.

Flag: ```picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr355...1af4}```
