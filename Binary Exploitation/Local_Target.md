# Description

Smash the stack <br>
Can you overflow the buffer and modify the other local <br>
variable? The program is available here. You can view source <br>
here. And connect with it using: <br>
```nc saturn.picoctf.net 64108```

# Solution

`wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/519/local-target`

`wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/519/local-target.c`

By looking at the source code, `cat local-target.c`, you can see that the goal is to get num to equal 65.

```nc saturn.picoctf.net 64108```

By running some tests knowing that you need to overflow you can get this string to get it to give 0:

"12345678901234567890123A"

Anything less would give 64. Anything more of different charaters gives varying numbers to num. When you add one more capital A it sets the number to 65 and gives the flag.

Flag: ```picoCTF{l0c4l5_1n_5c0p...8441a}```
